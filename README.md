# Bad-Browser

A random, short coding project made for college.

**REQUIREMENTS:**
  * pywhatkit (https://pypi.org/project/pywhatkit/)
  * time, webbrowser and random are installed along side python, no need for instalation

## What is this program?
Bad browser is an attempt to make browsing as painful and irritating as possible. It does this by displaying an image asking if the user is okay, searching for things that wasn't the users original wanted search, pulling up a special YouTube video and any other way I could think to make browsing just a little bit harder.

The application itself is quite simple only displaying the logo and asking the user for a search prompt.
